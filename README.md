## Build

This package uses autotools, so the usual `./configure && make` is enough to build
the programs. If cloning the bare sources, the package needs to be bootstrapped
in advance with `autoreconf -vfi`.

In addition to the standard build options the following are available:

`--enable-debug`:
compile with debugging messages,
disabled by default

`--with-out123`:
build with the out123 library providing support for additional audio interfaces;
enabled by default

`--with-libiconv-prefix[=DIR]`:
search for libiconv in DIR/include and DIR/lib

the character conversion requires presence of the POSIX/XSI iconv function family in either the C library or a separate libiconv library (see https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/AM_005fICONV.html)
