* Build

This package uses autotools so the usual ./configure && make is enough to build
the libraries. If cloning the bare sources the package need to be bootstrapped
in advance with the autoreconf -vfi command.

In addition to the standard build options the following are available:

--enable-debug
compile with debugging messages
disabled by default

--with-out123
Build with out123 library providing support for additional audio interfaces
enabled by default

--with-libiconv-prefix[=DIR]:
search for libiconv in DIR/include and DIR/lib

the character conversion requires presence of the POSIX/XSI iconv function family in either the C library or a separate libiconv library (see https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/AM_005fICONV.html)
